# Metamagical Themas

This is a small repository to keep track of snippets of code that were
inpired while reading the book "Metamagical Themas" by Douglas
Hofstadter.

The code has very few real-world applications; rather, this is a 
playful exploration into how code can parallel all the oddities of the
human brain.

__NOTE:__ Please read the docstrings at the top of each of the files;
this will give you an indication about how to use the code if you
want to try it out.
